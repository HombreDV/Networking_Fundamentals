What is the OSI model? Why is it important for understanding networking?
-design a standarized netwoek communications model to create consistency within the industry.
-make networks modular. no more proprietary networks
- Sender to Receiver
Sender: 
1)	Application
2)	presentation
	session
	transport
	network
	data link
7)	physical

Receiver:
	Application
	presentation
	session
	transport
	network
	data link
	Physical


What are the advantages of using a theoretical model to describe networking?

What is the name of Layer 3 in the OSI model? Layer 5?
- session = layer 5
- network = Layer 3
Which OSI model layers typically correspond to the network architecture?

How does the session ID differ from the port number?

Which OSI model layer would you find a frame at?
- Data link Layer.

What is the difference between connectionless and connection-oriented services?
- TCP is a connection based protocol because it takes advantage of sequencing, error correction, and flow control
	- UDP is connection less is concerned with moving data than if all will be getting there





Application Layer - Http , FTP, TFTP, SMTP
Presentation Layer - Syntax, Encryption, compression ssl
Session Layer - creating sessions between clients
Transport Layor - delivering data on the network, segements data, TCP/UDP
	- TCP is a connection based protocol because it takes advantage of sequencing, error correction, and flow control
	- UDP is connection less is concerned with moving data than if all will be getting there
Network layer - routing protocols specify how each router takes the data,IP Address
Data link layer - interface between physical transmittion media
Phyiscal Layer - coordinate rules for sending and receiving electrical signals
